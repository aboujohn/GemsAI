# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Internationalization with Hebrew Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure next-i18next for Hebrew-first approach with English fallback, ensuring proper RTL support throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Install and configure next-i18next package
2. Set up translation files structure for Hebrew (primary) and English (fallback)
3. Implement language detection and switching functionality
4. Create translation keys for all UI elements
5. Configure RTL layout switching based on language
6. Implement number and date formatting for Hebrew locale
7. Create a translation management system or workflow
8. Set up font loading for Hebrew characters
9. Implement direction-aware components that handle RTL/LTR differences
10. Create helper hooks for translation (useTranslation wrapper)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify correct language loading based on user preferences
2. Test language switching functionality
3. Validate RTL layout rendering in Hebrew mode
4. Check for any missing translations or fallback behavior
5. Test with native Hebrew speakers for linguistic accuracy
6. Verify proper number and date formatting in Hebrew

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up next-i18next configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure next-i18next in the Next.js application to enable internationalization support
### Details:
Install next-i18next package, create i18n.js configuration file, set up language namespaces, configure supported locales (including Hebrew), and integrate with Next.js config. Ensure SSR compatibility and proper loading of translation files.

## 2. Implement translation management system [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a structured system for managing translations across multiple languages
### Details:
Set up translation files for each supported language, organize translations by namespaces/categories, implement a translation key convention, create helper functions for translation access, and establish a workflow for adding new translation strings.

## 3. Develop RTL layout switching mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create a system to dynamically switch between LTR and RTL layouts based on language selection
### Details:
Implement direction detection based on language, set up CSS/styling approach for RTL support (using dir attribute or CSS variables), create RTL-aware components, handle text alignment, and ensure proper bidirectional text rendering for mixed content.

Successfully implemented comprehensive RTL layout switching mechanism:

**Core RTL Infrastructure Created:**
- `lib/utils/rtl.ts`: Comprehensive RTL utilities library with direction detection, spacing utilities, bidirectional text handling, CSS class generation, and transformation utilities
- `lib/hooks/useRTL.ts`: Complete set of RTL-aware React hooks including useRTL, useRTLClasses, useDirectionalStyles, useLayoutDirection, useRTLTransitions, useFormDirection, and useBidiContent

**Direction-Aware UI Components:**
- `DirectionalContainer`: Smart container with automatic RTL/LTR switching, spacing management, and direction attributes
- `DirectionalFlex`: Flex container with automatic direction reversal, start/end alignment, and RTL-aware justify/align properties
- `DirectionalInput`: Input component with content direction handling, bidirectional text support, and input type-specific behavior

**Enhanced CSS System:**
- Added comprehensive RTL utilities to `app/globals.css`
- Transform utilities (rotate, scale, translate) for RTL
- Position utilities (left/right swapping)
- Animation keyframes with RTL direction awareness
- Bidirectional text utilities (isolate, embed, override)
- Enhanced font support for Hebrew

**Features Implemented:**
- Dynamic HTML attribute updates (lang, dir) via enhanced LanguageProvider
- Direction detection based on language (Hebrew = RTL, English = LTR)
- Automatic CSS class generation for direction-aware styling
- Icon rotation for directional elements (arrows, chevrons)
- Form field direction handling with content type awareness
- Mixed bidirectional content support with Unicode formatting
- Smooth transitions between RTL/LTR modes
- Logical properties support for modern CSS features

**Demonstration System:**
- Created comprehensive `RTLDemo` component showcasing all features
- Added demo page at `/rtl-demo` for testing and validation
- Interactive examples of all RTL components and utilities

**Technical Achievements:**
- Type-safe RTL system with TypeScript support
- SSR-compatible implementation
- Performance optimized with useMemo for expensive calculations
- Accessibility-compliant with proper ARIA attributes
- Modern CSS logical properties where supported

The RTL layout switching mechanism is production-ready and provides a complete solution for Hebrew/English bidirectional interface support.

## 4. Implement language-specific formatting [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add support for locale-specific date, number, and currency formatting
### Details:
Create utility functions for formatting dates, numbers, and currencies according to locale conventions, implement plural rules handling, set up locale-specific validation rules, and ensure proper sorting of localized content.
<info added on 2025-06-05T19:52:40.197Z>
We've successfully implemented comprehensive language-specific formatting utilities for our internationalization system. The implementation includes:

1. Core formatting infrastructure:
   - Created `lib/utils/formatting.ts` with specialized formatter classes
   - Developed `lib/hooks/useFormatting.ts` with React hooks for all formatting needs

2. Implemented formatting features:
   - Date/Time: Multiple styles, relative formatting, Hebrew calendar support
   - Numbers/Currency: Locale-specific formatting, multi-currency support (ILS, USD, EUR)
   - Pluralization: Advanced rules with Hebrew-specific dual forms
   - List Formatting: Conjunction/disjunction with locale-appropriate separators
   - Validation: Region-specific validation (Israeli/US phone formats, postal codes)
   - Sorting: Locale-aware with mixed Hebrew/English content prioritization

3. Built demonstration system:
   - Created `components/ui/FormattingDemo.tsx` component
   - Added `/formatting-demo` page to showcase all formatting features
   - Enhanced translation files with formatting-specific keys

4. Technical highlights:
   - Type-safe implementation with full TypeScript support
   - Performance optimized with React hooks using useMemo
   - SSR compatibility with Next.js
   - Comprehensive locale configurations for he-IL and en-US
   - Hebrew specializations including calendar support and pluralization rules

The system integrates seamlessly with our existing LanguageProvider, RTL utilities, and translation system, providing production-ready locale support for both Hebrew and English.

## 5. Design database schema for internationalization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database entities and relationships to support multilingual content
### Details:
Design schema for storing translations (considering approaches like separate translation tables, JSON columns, or content duplication), plan for language metadata storage, ensure proper indexing for language-specific queries, and document the schema design decisions.

## 6. Implement ORM relationships and query optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Set up ORM mappings and optimize database queries for multilingual content
### Details:
Configure ORM entity relationships for translations, implement efficient query patterns for retrieving localized content, create migration scripts, develop seeding mechanism for multiple languages, and implement caching strategies for translation data.
