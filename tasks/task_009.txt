# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Persona-Guided Assistant Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the conversational AI assistant with persona templates to guide users through the story creation process.
# Details:
1. Design conversation flow for different user personas:
   - The Romantic Giver
   - The Self-Expressive Buyer
   - The Gift Explorer
2. Implement OpenAI GPT-4o integration for assistant conversations
3. Create prompt templates for each persona
4. Design UI for assistant conversation interface
5. Implement conversation state management
6. Create typing indicators and loading states
7. Implement conversation history storage
8. Add support for conversation branching based on user responses
9. Create fallback responses for unclear user inputs
10. Implement persona selection interface
11. Add support for switching personas mid-conversation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test conversation flow for each persona
2. Verify appropriate responses to user inputs
3. Test conversation state persistence
4. Validate branching logic based on user responses
5. Test fallback mechanisms for unclear inputs
6. Verify persona switching functionality
7. Test with both Hebrew and English conversations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Persona Templates Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a standardized template structure for defining different assistant personas
### Details:
Design a comprehensive schema for persona templates including personality traits, communication style, knowledge domains, response patterns, and tone indicators. Include fields for persona name, background story, expertise level, language preferences, and behavioral characteristics. Ensure the template is flexible enough to accommodate various types of personas while maintaining consistency.

## 2. Design Conversation Flow Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the high-level architecture for conversation flows between users and the persona-guided assistant
### Details:
Create diagrams and specifications for the conversation flow including entry points, branching logic, context preservation, topic transitions, and conversation termination. Define how the system will handle multi-turn conversations, interruptions, topic changes, and maintain coherence throughout interactions. Include error handling and fallback mechanisms.

## 3. Implement Conversation State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Develop the system for tracking and managing conversation state across interactions
### Details:
Build a robust state management system that tracks conversation history, user preferences, active persona, context variables, and interaction metadata. Implement mechanisms for state persistence, retrieval, and updates. Include functionality for handling session timeouts, context switching between personas, and maintaining conversation continuity across multiple sessions.

## 4. Develop AI Integration Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create the integration layer between the conversation system and underlying AI models
### Details:
Implement the technical integration with AI language models, including prompt engineering, context formatting, response parsing, and model parameter optimization. Design the interface for passing conversation context to the AI and processing its responses. Include mechanisms for handling model limitations, ensuring response quality, and managing token usage efficiently.

## 5. Create Persona Selection and Switching Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Implement functionality for selecting, activating, and switching between different personas
### Details:
Develop the system for persona initialization, selection criteria, and dynamic switching. Include user-triggered and context-based automatic switching mechanisms. Create interfaces for users to select personas explicitly or implicitly through conversation cues. Implement smooth transition handling when switching between personas mid-conversation.

## 6. Design User Interaction Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Define and implement standard interaction patterns for common conversation scenarios
### Details:
Create a library of interaction patterns for greeting users, handling questions, providing recommendations, managing clarifications, and other common conversation flows. Develop templates for persona-specific responses to standard situations. Include mechanisms for adapting these patterns based on the active persona's characteristics and the conversation context.

## 7. Implement Testing and Evaluation Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing system for evaluating persona-guided conversations
### Details:
Develop test scenarios, evaluation metrics, and quality assessment tools for the persona-guided assistant. Include automated tests for conversation flow, persona consistency, state management, and AI response quality. Create tools for human evaluation of conversations, collecting feedback, and iterative improvement. Implement logging and analytics to track performance across different personas and conversation types.
