# Task ID: 6
# Title: Configure Database Schema with Supabase
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema in Supabase according to the requirements, including tables for users, stories, sketches, products, jewelers, gifts, and orders.
# Details:
1. Design database schema with proper relationships
2. Create the following tables in Supabase:
   - users (id, email, name, role, created_at, updated_at)
   - stories (id, user_id, content, emotion_tags[], created_at, updated_at)
   - sketches (id, story_id, image_url, prompt, variants[], created_at)
   - products (id, jeweler_id, name, description, price, style_tags[], images[])
   - jewelers (id, user_id, name, bio, portfolio_url, created_at)
   - gifts (id, sender_id, recipient_email, message, share_token, created_at)
   - orders (id, user_id, product_id, status, payment_id, created_at)
3. Set up foreign key relationships and constraints
4. Configure row-level security policies
5. Create database indexes for performance
6. Set up database triggers for automated actions
7. Implement database migrations strategy
8. Create seed data for development

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify table creation and relationships
2. Test row-level security policies
3. Validate foreign key constraints
4. Test database triggers
5. Benchmark query performance with indexes
6. Verify migration process
7. Test with seed data to ensure proper functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Database Tables and Columns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core database tables with appropriate columns, data types, and constraints
### Details:
Identify all required entities, define table structures with appropriate primary keys, determine column data types and constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.), and document the purpose of each table and column

## 2. Establish Table Relationships [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Configure foreign keys and relationships between database tables
### Details:
Define one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, implement foreign key constraints with appropriate ON DELETE/UPDATE actions, and create junction tables for many-to-many relationships

## 3. Implement Database Indexes [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create appropriate indexes to optimize query performance
### Details:
Identify columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY statements, create indexes on these columns, and consider composite indexes for multi-column queries

## 4. Configure Database Security Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement row-level security, access controls, and data protection measures
### Details:
Define role-based access control (RBAC) policies, implement row-level security (RLS) policies, set up column-level permissions, and configure data encryption for sensitive information

## 5. Develop Database Migration Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create migration scripts and version control for the database schema
### Details:
Set up a migration framework, create baseline migration scripts, implement up/down migration capabilities, establish a versioning system, and document the migration process for future schema changes
