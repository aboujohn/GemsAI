2. Create prompt engineering for emotion detection
3. Design emotion tagging schema with primary and secondary emotions
4. Implement caching for emotion analysis results
5. Create frontend UI for displaying detected emotions
6. Implement tag editing interface for users
7. Create emotion confidence scoring
8. Implement emotion tag storage in database
9. Create emotion visualization component
10. Add support for custom user-defined emotion tags
11. Implement emotion tag normalization and validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test emotion detection with various story types
2. Verify accuracy of emotion tagging
3. Test caching mechanism
4. Validate tag editing functionality
5. Test with both Hebrew and English content
6. Verify database storage of emotion tags
7. Test emotion visualization rendering

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design AI Integration Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the architecture for integrating GPT-4o into the emotion detection system
### Details:
Define API endpoints, authentication methods, request/response formats, error handling, and rate limiting strategies for GPT-4o integration. Document the data flow between the application and the AI model. Include considerations for handling model versioning and fallback mechanisms.

## 2. Develop Emotion Analysis Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create algorithms to analyze and classify emotions from text and other inputs
### Details:
Implement NLP techniques to extract emotional context from text. Define emotion categories (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, etc.) and their intensity levels. Create a scoring system for emotion detection confidence. Include methods for handling ambiguous emotional content and contextual analysis.

## 3. Build Tag Management System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop a system to create, store, and manage emotion tags
### Details:
Create database schema for storing emotion tags with attributes like name, category, intensity, and metadata. Implement CRUD operations for tag management. Design tag hierarchies and relationships. Include functionality for tag merging, splitting, and batch operations.

## 4. Create Tagging User Interface [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Design and implement the user interface for manual emotion tagging
### Details:
Design intuitive UI components for tag selection, creation, and application. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for tagging. Create keyboard shortcuts for efficient tagging. Include features for tag filtering, searching, and favorites. Design UI for batch tagging operations.

## 5. Develop Emotion Visualization Components [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create visual representations of detected emotions and their distributions
### Details:
Implement charts and graphs to visualize emotion distributions (pie charts, bar graphs, heat maps). Create timeline visualizations for emotion changes over time. Design color coding systems for different emotions. Include interactive elements for exploring emotion data. Ensure visualizations are accessible and responsive.

## 6. Implement Editing Interface for AI Suggestions [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.4
### Description: Create an interface for users to review, edit, and approve AI-generated emotion tags
### Details:
Design a side-by-side comparison view of original content and AI suggestions. Implement controls for accepting, rejecting, or modifying AI tags. Create a feedback mechanism to improve AI accuracy over time. Include confidence indicators for AI suggestions. Design batch approval workflows for multiple items.

## 7. Integrate and Test Complete System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Combine all components and perform comprehensive testing of the emotion detection system
### Details:
Integrate all components into a cohesive system. Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Conduct performance testing under various loads. Test with diverse content types and edge cases. Implement user acceptance testing with representative users. Document test results and fix identified issues.
