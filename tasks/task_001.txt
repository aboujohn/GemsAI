# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the base Next.js project with App Router, TypeScript configuration, and project structure according to the PRD requirements.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript template
2. Configure App Router structure with appropriate folder organization
3. Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled
4. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
5. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
6. Create base layout components and page structure
7. Set up environment variables structure (.env.local, .env.development)
8. Implement basic folder structure:
   - app/ (for App Router pages)
   - components/ (for UI components)
   - lib/ (for utility functions)
   - sdk/ (for API client functions)
   - styles/ (for global styles)
   - public/ (for static assets)

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful build with `next build`
2. Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors
3. Confirm App Router navigation works between basic pages
4. Test development server starts correctly
5. Validate ESLint and Prettier configurations work as expected

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Next.js Project with TypeScript and Configure Base Settings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support using create-next-app and configure the base project settings.
### Details:
Run `npx create-next-app@latest` with the following options: TypeScript (yes), ESLint (yes), Tailwind CSS (optional based on PRD), App Router (yes), customize import alias (yes, use @/ prefix). After creation, update tsconfig.json to enable strict mode and other TypeScript features. Initialize Git repository with `git init` and create a comprehensive .gitignore file that includes node_modules, .next, .env.local, etc.

## 2. Set Up Project Folder Structure and App Router Organization [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the folder structure for the project following Next.js best practices with App Router architecture.
### Details:
Create the following directory structure: app/ (with page.tsx, layout.tsx, and error.tsx), components/ (with subdirectories for ui/, layout/, forms/), lib/ (for utility functions), sdk/ (for API client functions), styles/ (for global CSS), public/ (for static assets), and types/ (for TypeScript type definitions). Within the app directory, implement the routing structure according to the PRD requirements with appropriate nested routes.

## 3. Configure Development Tools and Code Quality Standards [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up ESLint, Prettier, and other development tools to ensure code quality and consistent formatting.
### Details:
Configure ESLint by extending the Next.js defaults and adding custom rules as needed. Create .eslintrc.json with appropriate TypeScript settings. Set up Prettier with .prettierrc for code formatting standards. Add scripts to package.json for linting and formatting. Configure VS Code settings (settings.json and extensions.json) to recommend ESLint and Prettier extensions. Create a pre-commit hook using husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality on commits.

## 4. Implement Environment Variables and Configuration Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up environment variable handling for different environments and create configuration management utilities.
### Details:
Create .env.example with all required environment variables documented. Create .env.local for local development (add to .gitignore). Create .env.development and .env.production for environment-specific variables. Implement a configuration module in lib/config.ts that validates required environment variables at build time using zod schema validation. Add documentation for environment setup in README.md. Create a script to validate environment variables during build process.

## 5. Create Base Layout Components and Page Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement the base layout components and page structure that will be used throughout the application.
### Details:
Create a root layout.tsx in the app directory with HTML, body, and metadata setup. Implement a components/layout/Header.tsx and components/layout/Footer.tsx. Create a components/ui/Container.tsx for consistent page widths. Set up global CSS in styles/globals.css with CSS reset and base styles. Implement basic responsive design utilities. Create placeholder components for common UI elements mentioned in the PRD. Set up metadata configuration for SEO in app/layout.tsx using Next.js metadata API.
