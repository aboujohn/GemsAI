### 10. Admin & Analytics

- Develop metrics dashboard with key performance indicators:
  - Story completion rate
  - Emotion match feedback
  - Sketch feedback scores
  - Share and reaction metrics
- Implement Slack alerts for system issues:
  - Sketch queue time alerts (queue > 5 items for 2+ minutes)
  - Failed sketch generations
  - Payment failures
  - API latency issues
- Create log viewer with search and filtering
- Build A/B test tracking system using Posthog with custom events
- Implement user behavior analytics with cohort and session tagging

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### 11. Implement Testing Framework

- Set up Jest for unit testing
