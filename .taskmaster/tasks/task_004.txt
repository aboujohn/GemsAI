## Implementation Summary:
Successfully implemented comprehensive route protection and role-based access control system.

## Key Components Created:

### 1. AuthGuard Component (`components/providers/AuthGuard.tsx`)
- Flexible authentication guard with configurable requirements
- Support for role-based access control (user, jeweler, admin)
- Loading states and fallback components
- Convenience components: UserGuard, JewelerGuard, AdminGuard
- Higher-order component (withAuthGuard) for page protection

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Hooks (`lib/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- useAuthRedirect: Handles authentication redirects with URL parameters
- useRequireRole: Role-based access control with automatic redirects
- useAuthForm: Form state management with error handling
- useSessionManager: Auto-refresh sessions before expiry
- useUserProfile: Profile management utilities
- useAuthStatus: Authentication status with localStorage persistence
- useAuthErrorHandler: User-friendly error message mapping

### 3. Next.js Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Server-side route protection using Supabase middleware client
- Protected routes: /dashboard, /story, /profile, /settings
- Role-based routes: /dashboard/admin (admin only), /dashboard/jeweler (jeweler+admin)
- Public-only routes: /auth pages (redirect authenticated users)
- Automatic session refresh for Server Components
- Development debug headers

### 4. Protected Page Examples
- Updated `/dashboard` page with AuthGuard protection
- Created `/dashboard/settings` page with role-based features
- Demonstrates user profile management and password updates
- Role-specific UI elements and features

## Technical Features:
- TypeScript support throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading states and user feedback
- Session persistence and auto-refresh
- RTL support maintained
- Responsive design
- Integration with existing UI components

## Security Features:
- Server-side route protection via middleware
- Client-side guards for additional UX
- Role-based access control
- Session validation and refresh
- Secure password updates
- Protected API routes (excluded from middleware)

## Testing Capabilities:
- Authentication state persistence
- Role-based redirects
- Session expiry handling
- Error state management
- Loading state transitions
