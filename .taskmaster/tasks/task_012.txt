# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Redis and BullMQ for Job Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Redis for caching and queue management, and implement BullMQ for processing sketch generation and other background jobs.
# Details:
1. Set up Redis instance and configure connection
2. Implement Redis caching service
3. Configure BullMQ queues for different job types:
   - sketch-generation
   - emotion-analysis
   - email-notifications
   - payment-processing
4. Create job producers for each queue
5. Implement job consumers with appropriate concurrency
6. Set up retry strategies for failed jobs
7. Create job monitoring dashboard
8. Implement job prioritization logic
9. Set up dead letter queues for failed jobs
10. Create alerting for queue health issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Redis connection and caching functionality
2. Verify job queuing and processing
3. Test retry mechanism for failed jobs
4. Validate job prioritization
5. Test dead letter queue functionality
6. Verify monitoring dashboard displays correct information
7. Test alerting for queue issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Redis Configuration for Job Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure Redis instance optimized for job queue processing
### Details:
Install Redis, configure persistence settings, memory limits, and network security. Implement proper backup strategies and ensure high availability configuration. Document connection parameters for other components.

## 2. BullMQ Queue Architecture Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Design and implement the BullMQ queue structure with appropriate configurations
### Details:
Define queue types (standard, priority, delayed), set up retry strategies, configure concurrency limits, and implement dead-letter queues for failed jobs. Document queue naming conventions and usage patterns.

## 3. Job Producer Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop the job producer components that will add jobs to the queues
### Details:
Create abstraction layers for job creation, implement job serialization/validation, add support for job priorities and scheduling, and ensure proper error handling. Include documentation for integration with other services.

## 4. Job Consumer Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop the worker processes that will consume and process jobs from the queues
### Details:
Implement worker processes with proper concurrency controls, error handling, retry logic, and graceful shutdown. Create pluggable job handler architecture and logging system for job execution.

## 5. Monitoring Dashboard Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Create a dashboard for monitoring queue health and job processing metrics
### Details:
Implement real-time queue statistics visualization, job success/failure rates, processing times, and queue depths. Add alerting for queue backlogs and failed jobs. Create admin interface for manual job management.

## 6. System Integration and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Integrate the job processing system with other application components and perform comprehensive testing
### Details:
Create integration tests for all queue types, simulate high load scenarios, test failure recovery mechanisms, and validate monitoring accuracy. Document system performance characteristics and limitations.
