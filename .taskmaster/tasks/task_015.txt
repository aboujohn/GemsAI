# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Product Match Algorithm Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the requirements and specifications for the product match engine, including emotion-to-style mapping criteria and key matching parameters.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive document outlining the product matching requirements, including: emotional factors to consider, style attributes to map, matching precision goals, performance requirements, and integration points with existing systems. Include user personas and sample matching scenarios.

## 2. Design Emotion-to-Style Mapping Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create the conceptual framework for mapping emotional inputs to product style attributes with appropriate weighting factors.
### Details:
Develop a structured mapping between emotional states (e.g., 'energetic', 'calm', 'professional') and product style attributes (e.g., 'color palette', 'pattern density', 'formality'). Include weighting mechanisms to prioritize certain attributes based on context. Document the mapping logic with examples and edge cases.

## 3. Implement Core Matching Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop the core matching algorithm that processes input criteria and returns relevant product matches based on the emotion-to-style mapping.
### Details:
Code the matching algorithm using appropriate data structures for efficient comparison. Implement vector-based similarity calculations, filtering mechanisms, and sorting logic. Include unit tests with various input scenarios and expected outputs. Document the algorithm's time and space complexity.

## 4. Build Search Functionality and Query Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Implement the search interface and query processing components that will handle user inputs and translate them into algorithm parameters.
### Details:
Create query parsers that handle various input formats (text, visual, emotional indicators). Implement query expansion for better matching results. Build search API endpoints with appropriate parameter validation. Include error handling for malformed queries and performance monitoring.

## 5. Develop Relevance Scoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create a sophisticated scoring system to rank product matches based on relevance to emotional and style criteria.
### Details:
Implement a multi-factor scoring algorithm that considers attribute matches, contextual relevance, and confidence levels. Create tunable parameters for adjusting scoring weights. Build visualization tools for score explanation. Include A/B testing framework to compare different scoring approaches.

## 6. Implement Caching and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Design and implement caching mechanisms and performance optimizations to ensure the matching engine operates efficiently at scale.
### Details:
Create a multi-level caching strategy for frequent queries and partial results. Implement database query optimization techniques including indexing strategies and query restructuring. Add performance monitoring instrumentation. Document cache invalidation policies and scaling considerations.

## 7. Develop Personalization Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.5, 15.6
### Description: Implement personalization capabilities that adapt product matches based on user history, preferences, and behavior patterns.
### Details:
Create user profile models that capture relevant preferences. Implement personalization algorithms that adjust match results based on historical interactions. Build feedback mechanisms to improve personalization over time. Include privacy controls and preference management interfaces. Test with diverse user scenarios.
