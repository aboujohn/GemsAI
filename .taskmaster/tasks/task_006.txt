✅ **COMPLETED: Relationships and Constraints Setup**

Created comprehensive `docs/supabase/003_create_relationships_constraints.sql` with:

**Foreign Key Relationships:**
- All core table relationships established (users → stories → sketches, jewelers → products, orders linking all entities)
- Proper CASCADE and RESTRICT behaviors for data integrity
- Translation table relationships with metadata

**Check Constraints:**
- Email and phone format validation
- Rating ranges (1-5 for reviews, 0-5 for jewelers)
- Budget and timeline enums validation
- Price and inventory non-negative constraints
- Date logic constraints (delivery dates, gift expiration)

**Unique Constraints:**
- Business logic uniqueness (email, order numbers, gift tokens)
- Composite uniqueness (jeweler SKUs, sketch-product matches)
- Conditional uniqueness with WHERE clauses

**Junction Tables:**
- User favorites (products, jewelers)
- Product categorization and tagging system
- Story tagging for emotion/style classification
- Hierarchical categories with parent-child relationships

**Business Logic Functions:**
- Access control helpers (jeweler order access, user review validation)
- Audit logging system with triggers
- Security helper functions for application use

**Performance Features:**
- Materialized views for popular products and jeweler performance
