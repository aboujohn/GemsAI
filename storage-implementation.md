# AWS S3 and CloudFront Storage Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Task 11: Set Up AWS S3 and CloudFront for Media Storage.

## 🚨 Important Development Strategy

**For Development Phase**: We will use **local file system storage** on the development machine. The AWS S3 and CloudFront implementation provided is **production-ready** but will be activated during the migration to production deployment.

**For Production Phase**: Full AWS S3 + CloudFront migration will happen when the application is ready for production deployment.

## Overview

The implementation provides a comprehensive file storage solution that supports both:
1. **Local Development Storage** - File system based storage for development
2. **Production AWS Storage** - AWS S3 buckets and CloudFront CDN for production

## Development vs Production Architecture

### 🛠️ Development Mode (Current)
- **Storage**: Local file system (`./uploads/` directory)
- **File Organization**: Mimics S3 bucket structure locally
- **CDN**: Direct file serving (no CloudFront needed)
- **Configuration**: Minimal setup, no AWS credentials required
- **Performance**: Fast local access for development

### 🚀 Production Mode (Future Migration)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 buckets (sketches, products, user-uploads, gifts)
- **CDN**: CloudFront distribution for global delivery
- **Configuration**: Full AWS setup with credentials and buckets
- **Performance**: Globally distributed, enterprise-grade

## Features Implemented

### 1. Hybrid Storage System
- ✅ **Local File Storage**: Development-friendly local storage
- ✅ **AWS S3 Integration**: Production-ready AWS implementation
- ✅ **Configuration Switch**: Environment-based storage selection
- ✅ **Seamless Migration**: Easy switch from local to AWS

### 2. File Organization (Both Modes)
- ✅ **Multiple Categories**: sketches, products, user-uploads, gifts
- ✅ **Organized Structure**: Category-based file organization
- ✅ **Safe Filenames**: Prevents conflicts and security issues
- ✅ **Metadata Storage**: File information and upload details

### 3. File Operations (Universal)
- ✅ **Upload Files**: Single and bulk upload support
- ✅ **Download Files**: Direct file access
- ✅ **Delete Files**: Safe deletion with cleanup
- ✅ **File Validation**: Type, size, and security checks
- ✅ **List Files**: Browse and search functionality

### 4. Image Processing Pipeline
- ✅ **Format Support**: JPEG, PNG, WebP output
- ✅ **Auto-resizing**: Multiple size variants (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Optimized compression
- ✅ **Advanced Features**: Watermarking, format conversion

### 5. Security & Validation
- ✅ **File Type Validation**: Comprehensive security checks
- ✅ **Size Limits**: Configurable per file type
- ✅ **Content Validation**: Ensures file integrity
- ✅ **Safe Processing**: Prevents malicious uploads

## Development Configuration

### Local Storage Setup (Current)
```bash
# Basic configuration for local development
NODE_ENV=development
STORAGE_MODE=local
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=50MB

# Optional: Set up for future AWS migration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# AWS credentials will be added when migrating to production
```

### Local Directory Structure
```
./uploads/
├── sketches/          # Sketch files and drawings
├── products/          # Product images and media  
├── user-uploads/      # General user content
├── gifts/             # Gift-related media
└── optimized/         # Auto-generated image variants
    ├── thumbnails/
    ├── small/
    ├── medium/
    └── large/
```

## Production Configuration (Future)

### AWS Configuration (For Migration)
```bash
# Production AWS setup
NODE_ENV=production
STORAGE_MODE=aws

# AWS Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# S3 Buckets
AWS_S3_BUCKET_SKETCHES=gemsai-sketches-prod
AWS_S3_BUCKET_PRODUCTS=gemsai-products-prod
AWS_S3_BUCKET_USER_UPLOADS=gemsai-uploads-prod
AWS_S3_BUCKET_GIFTS=gemsai-gifts-prod

# CloudFront Distribution
AWS_CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=d1234567890.cloudfront.net
```

## API Endpoints (Works in Both Modes)

All storage endpoints work identically in both development and production:

- `POST /storage/upload/:category` - Upload single file
- `POST /storage/upload-multiple/:category` - Upload multiple files
- `GET /storage/file/:category/:filename` - Download/access file
- `DELETE /storage/:category/:filename` - Delete file
- `GET /storage/list/:category` - List files in category
- `GET /storage/stats` - Get storage statistics

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Development (Current)
1. ✅ Local file system storage
2. ✅ All features working locally
3. ✅ File validation and processing
4. ✅ Image optimization pipeline

### Phase 2: AWS Preparation (When Ready)
1. 🔄 Create AWS S3 buckets
2. 🔄 Set up CloudFront distribution
3. 🔄 Configure AWS credentials
4. 🔄 Test AWS functionality

### Phase 3: Production Migration (Future)
1. 🔄 Switch `STORAGE_MODE` from `local` to `aws`
2. 🔄 Migrate existing files to S3
3. 🔄 Update DNS/CDN configuration
4. 🔄 Monitor and optimize performance

## File Validation Rules (Both Modes)

| File Type | Max Size | Allowed Formats | Extensions |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Image | 10MB | JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF | .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .gif |
| Sketch | 25MB | Image formats + PDF, SVG | .jpg, .png, .svg, .pdf |
| Document | 20MB | PDF, Text, Word | .pdf, .txt, .doc, .docx |
| Video | 100MB | MP4, WebM, MOV | .mp4, .webm, .mov |

## Development Benefits

### Local Storage Advantages
- 🚀 **Fast Development**: No network latency
- 💰 **Cost-Free**: No AWS costs during development
- 🔧 **Easy Setup**: No complex cloud configuration
- 🔍 **Easy Debugging**: Direct file system access
- 📁 **Version Control**: Can include sample files in repo

### Seamless Production Migration
- 🔄 **No Code Changes**: Same API, different storage backend
- 📈 **Scalable**: AWS handles production load
- 🌍 **Global CDN**: Worldwide content delivery
- 🔒 **Enterprise Security**: AWS security and compliance

## Usage Examples

### Development Upload
```typescript
// Works the same in both modes
const result = await storageService.uploadFile(file, {
  category: 'sketches',
  fileType: 'image',
  generateSizes: true,
});

// Local: Saves to ./uploads/sketches/
// AWS: Saves to S3 bucket gemsai-sketches-prod
```

### File Access
```typescript
// Development: http://localhost:3001/storage/file/sketches/image.jpg
// Production: https://d1234567890.cloudfront.net/sketches/image.jpg
const url = storageService.getFileUrl('sketches', 'image.jpg');
```

   - Configure bucket policies and CORS

3. **CloudFront Setup**
   - Create distribution pointing to S3 buckets
   - Configure cache behaviors and TTL

4. **Environment Migration**
   - Switch `STORAGE_MODE` from `local` to `aws`
   - Add AWS credentials to production environment

5. **Data Migration**
   - Upload existing local files to S3
   - Update file URLs in database

6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor CloudFront cache hit rates
   - Optimize cache strategies

This hybrid approach ensures smooth development while maintaining production-grade scalability for the future.
